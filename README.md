# Welcome to My Technical Documentation Portfolio

## About Me
Hi, I'm **Bernard Appah**,  I'm a passionate software engineer and technical writer who loves making complex information accessible. 
I embrace the Docs as Code approach, which means I integrate documentation right into the development process using tools 
like Git, Markdown, and CI/CD. My goal is to create clear and user-friendly documentation that helps developers, engineers,
and end-users understand and utilize technology more effectively.
