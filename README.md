# Welcome to My Technical Documentation Portfolio

## About Me
Hi, I'm **Bernard Appah**, a passionate software engineer, technical writer and software documentation specialist who embraces 
the Docs as Code approach, integrating documentation into the development workflow with tools like Git, Markdown, and CI/CD. 
I create clear, concise, and user-friendly documentation for developers, engineers, and end-users.
