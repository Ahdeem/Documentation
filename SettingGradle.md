This guide would illustrate how to set up a gradle project from scratch without any
hassle.

Assuming you already know what gradle is,then you can skip the remainder of this section 
and move over to the next section.

Gradle in simple terms is a build tool that is used to automate the building, testing
and deployment of software projects. It has become popular in recent times when compared
to its counterpart in maven because of its performance advantages and the fact that is built
for modern frameworks.
